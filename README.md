# Http Server with Java

Hello there, this is a fully qualified http server with practical checks and working of a TCP server. This is created
just out of fun and knowledge. It's derived from the famous CodeCrafters, which gave this project a start and the topics to 
carry forward in the upcoming updates.

Currently, it's capable of extracting the URL path from the request and classify if the resource exists in the server or not.
